# SpotifyVolumeChanger

`npm install`
because I'm too busy/lazy to make these stand alone executables for the 2 people (which is generous if I'm being honest) who see this repo

Set your hotkeys to your preferences in config.json, you should just be able to run using the executables given
When the executable runs, you'll be prompted to log in with spotify and then the browser tab will close.

the `"showKeyDetections"` field in config sets the code to print every key that's pressed in the format that the config accepts so you can test hotkeys and stuff.

lmk if you have any questions
